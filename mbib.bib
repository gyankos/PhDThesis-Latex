		first principles. Among the subjects covered are: various
		equivalent approaches to effective computability and their
		relations with computers and programming languages; a
		discussion of Church's thesis; a modern solution to Post's
		problem; global properties of Turing degrees; and a
		complete algebraic characterization of many-one degrees.
		Included are a number of applications to logic (in
		particular G\"{o}del's theorems) and to computer science,
		for which Recursion Theory provides the theoretical
		foundation.}},

		Several machine architectures based on hash are presented.
		We propose a data base machineGRACE which adopts a novel
		relational algebraic processing algorithm based on hash and
		sort. Whereas conventional logic-per-track machines perform
		poorly in a join dominant environment,GRACE can execute
		join efficiently inO(N+M/K) time, whereN andM are the

		becoming unmanageable, its size is kept small by placing
		low-probability tuples in a special Cutoff Index that is
		consulted only when queries for low-probability values are
		run. We also propose several other optimizations, including
		techniques to improve secondary index performance and
		techniques to reduce maintenance costs and fragmentation by
		buffering changes to the table and writing updates in
		sequential batches. Finally, we develop cost models for
		UPIs to estimate query performance in various settings to
		help automatically select tuning parameters of a UPI. We

		main result is that SPARQL and non-recursive safe Datalog
		with negation have equivalent expressive power, and hence,
		by classical results, SPARQL is equivalent from an
		expressiveness point of view to Relational Algebra. We
		present explicit generic rules of the transformations in
		both directions. Among other findings of the paper are the
		proof that negation can be simulated in SPARQL, that
		non-safe filters are superfluous, and that current SPARQL
		W3C semantics can be simplified to a standard compositional
		one.},
