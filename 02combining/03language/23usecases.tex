\section{GSQL Use cases}\label{ssec:travgraphop}
The previous section showed that GSQL is able to express set, relational and semistructured operators. This section shows that
%After showing that GSQL may be used to query structured and semistructured data, I now want to show that 
such minimal operators' set may be also adopted for 
%other and more practical use cases, such as 
\begin{mylist}
	\item providing nested graph operators including data mining manipulating ones (Subsection \vref{ssec:ngrahop}),
	\item providing a semantics for graphs and semistructured traversal languages (Subsection \vref{traversalDef}),
	\item performing \textbf{is-a} aggregations by combining nested graphs with semistructured hierarchies (Subsection \vref{subsec:representingisa}),
	\item and implementing the definition of a generalized graph grammar operator for nested graphs (Subsection \vref{sec:semistructunstradata}).
\end{mylist} Such definitions may adopt basic GSQL operator or may require derived GSQL operators.
