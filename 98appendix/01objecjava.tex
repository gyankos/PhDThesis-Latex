\chapter{Resolving Alignments and Morphisms: OCaml Source Code}\label{appendix:realignments}

This appendix provides the code of the reconciliation of the matchings between hub schema and data via the data's source schema, provided as an outcome of the visit of the alignments (between the source schema and the hub schema) and of the morphisms (associating the data to its source schema).  In order to do so, the GSM data model is also provided, alongside with some required utility functions. The following procedure describes the more theoretical concepts presented in Example \vref{ex:examplereferencedOcaml}.
