Contrariwise to current graph query languages' surveys \cite{AnglesABHRV17}, we're going to classify them not only from their expressiveness and ability to perform several forms of traversal and matching queries but also by their ability to generate new graph data. Therefore, graph Query Languages can be categorised in three main classes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first class  tries to find a
	possible match for a specific traversal  or for extracting all the subgraphs that match a given pattern (Section \vref{sec:gtl}). Such graph
	queries do not necessarily manipulate the graph data structure, but they  traverse it using data properties which select the pieces of informations that must be returned after the visiting process.
	\item Graph grammars  are used to select  parts of a same graph and create new vertices and edges by using rewriting rules (Section \vref{subsec:ggram}). These languages provide the possibility of adding and removing new vertices and edgesh which do not necessarily depend on previous data.
	\item Graph algebras extend the previous operations with set and simil-relational algebra operators for graphs (Section \vref{cite:galg}). These languages permit n-ary operators and the modification (projection, extension) of already-existing objects. Some graph algebras also provide operators accepting as inputs (or returning) graph collections.
	\item The last class of languages are ``proper'' graph query languages, that include within their expressive power all the aforementioned class of operations (Section \vref{subsec:proper}).
\end{enumerate}
