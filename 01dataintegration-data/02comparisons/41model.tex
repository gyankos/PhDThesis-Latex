\section{Graph (Data) Models}\label{sec:datamodelglit}
The graph database models proposed in current literature are directly derived from the standard graph definition $G=(V,E)$,
where $V$ is the vertices' set and $E\subseteq V\times V$ is the edges' set.
%In addition to the existing data models, we are going to deal with graph data structures that are often used in
%literature.
