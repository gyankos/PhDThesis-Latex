Graph data models directly overcome the semantic overloading problem by distinguishing entities and relationships, respectively represented as vertices and edges. In particular, graphs $G$ are represented as pairs $(V,E)$, where $V$ is the vertices' set and $E\subseteq V\times V$ is the edges' set. This popular theoretical data structure has been variously extended to support data representations. Such solutions are going to be discussed in the following paragraphs.



%%The graph database models proposed in current literature are directly derived from the standard graph definition $G=(V,E)$,
%%where $V$ is the vertices' set and $E\subseteq V\times V$ is the edges' set.
%In addition to the existing data models, we are going to deal with graph data structures that are often used in
%literature.
